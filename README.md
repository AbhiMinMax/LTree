- **Two-Tier Predictions**: 
  - Abstract aspects (within your control) - highly predictable

- **Pattern Recognition**: Tracks choice patterns over time
- **Reality Check System**: Honest assessments that prepare for life's frequent disappointments
- **Mobile-First Design**: Responsive interface optimized for all devices
- **Privacy-Focused**: All data stored locally in browser (no servers)
